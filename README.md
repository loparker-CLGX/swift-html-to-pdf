## Overview

swift-html-to-pdf provides HTML to PDF conversion with actor-based resource pooling, streaming results, and Swift 6 strict concurrency. Built on WKWebView for native rendering quality and performance.

## Features

- Streaming PDF generation with AsyncStream for progressive results
- WebView resource pooling with automatic lifecycle management
- Swift 6 strict concurrency with Sendable guarantees
- Optional type-safe HTML DSL integration via swift-html
- Swift Metrics integration for production monitoring
- Performance: 1,939 PDFs/sec continuous mode, 677 PDFs/sec paginated mode
- Memory efficiency: 35 MB steady-state with 4-24 workers
- Support for both continuous and paginated rendering modes

## Installation

Add swift-html-to-pdf to your Package.swift:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-html-to-pdf.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Add to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "HtmlToPdf", package: "swift-html-to-pdf")
    ]
)
```

### Optional: Type-Safe HTML DSL

To use the swift-html integration, enable the HTML trait:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-html-to-pdf.git",
        from: "1.0.0",
        traits: ["HTML"]
    )
]
```

### Requirements

- Swift 6.0+
- macOS 14.0+ or iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 16.0+

## Quick Start

### HTML String to PDF

```swift
import HtmlToPdf
import Dependencies

@Dependency(\.pdf) var pdf

// Render to file
try await pdf.render(html: "<h1>Invoice #1234</h1>", to: fileURL)

// Render to data (in-memory)
let pdfData = try await pdf.render(html: "<h1>Receipt</h1>")

// Batch processing with streaming results
let html = invoices.map { "<html><body>\($0.html)</body></html>" }
for try await result in try await pdf.render(html: html, to: directory) {
    print("Generated \(result.url)")
}
```

### Type-Safe HTML (with HTML trait enabled)

```swift
import HtmlToPdf

struct Invoice: HTML {
    let number: Int
    let total: Decimal

    var body: some HTML {
        h1 { "Invoice #\(number)" }
        p { "Total: $\(total)" }
    }
}

@Dependency(\.pdf) var pdf
try await pdf.render(html: Invoice(number: 1234, total: 99.99), to: fileURL)
```

Or use inline HTML:

```swift
import HtmlToPdf

let invoice = HTMLDocument {
    h1 { "Invoice #1234" }
    p { "Total: $99.99" }
}

@Dependency(\.pdf) var pdf
try await pdf.render(html: invoice, to: fileURL)
```

## Usage Examples

### Streaming Results

Process PDFs as they are generated:

```swift
for try await result in try await pdf.render(html: html, to: directory) {
    // PDF is ready immediately
    try await uploadToS3(result.url)
    try await db.markComplete(result.index)
}
```

Benefits: lower latency, constant memory usage, real-time progress tracking.

### Configuration

Customize paper size, margins, pagination, and concurrency:

```swift
try await withDependencies {
    $0.pdf.render.configuration.paperSize = .letter
    $0.pdf.render.configuration.margins = .wide
    $0.pdf.render.configuration.paginationMode = .paginated
    $0.pdf.render.configuration.concurrency = .automatic
} operation: {
    try await pdf.render(html: html, to: fileURL)
}
```

Available options:
- Paper sizes: .a4, .letter, .legal, .a3, .a5, or custom CGSize
- Margins: .none, .minimal, .standard, .comfortable, .wide, or custom EdgeInsets
- Pagination: .continuous (fast), .paginated (print-ready), .automatic
- Concurrency: .automatic (1x CPU), .fixed(n), or specific count

See [Configuration Guide](Sources/HtmlToPdf/Documentation.docc/ConfigurationGuide.md) for details.

## Performance

### Benchmarks

Continuous mode (single-page, maximum speed):

| Batch Size | Throughput    | Avg Latency | Memory |
|------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 100        | 1,772/sec     | 0.56ms      | 146 MB |
| 1,000      | 1,939/sec     | 0.52ms      | 146 MB |
| 10,000     | 1,814/sec     | 0.55ms      | 148 MB |

Paginated mode (multi-page, print-ready):

| Batch Size | Throughput    | Avg Latency | Memory |
|------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 100        | 142/sec       | 7.05ms      | 102 MB |
| 1,000      | 677/sec       | 1.48ms      | 110 MB |
| 10,000     | 485/sec       | 2.06ms      | 137 MB |

Test environment: macOS 26.0, Apple Silicon M1 (8 cores), 24 GB RAM, Swift 6.2

### Memory Usage

Memory usage remains constant across concurrency levels:

| Concurrency | Steady-State | Peak  | Expected  |
|-------------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| 4 workers   | 34 MB        | 34 MB | 400 MB    |
| 8 workers   | 34 MB        | 35 MB | 800 MB    |
| 16 workers  | 35 MB        | 35 MB | 1,600 MB  |
| 24 workers  | 35 MB        | 35 MB | 2,400 MB  |

Shared WebKit infrastructure provides memory efficiency. Memory determined by pool overhead, not worker count.

Measured with 50+ PDF warmup and sustained rendering workload. See `WebViewMemoryTests.swift` for methodology.

## Architecture

### WebView Resource Pooling

- Pre-warmed WKWebView instances for immediate availability
- Automatic lifecycle management
- FIFO fairness under load
- Optimal concurrency: 1x CPU count (8 WebViews on 8-core Mac)
- Powered by [swift-resource-pool](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-resource-pool)

### Swift 6 Concurrency

- Full type safety in concurrent code
- Sendable guarantees throughout
- Actor-isolated state management
- No data races possible

## Monitoring

Export metrics to Prometheus, StatsD, or other systems via [swift-metrics](https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics):

```swift
import Metrics
import Prometheus

// Bootstrap once at startup
MetricsSystem.bootstrap(PrometheusMetricsFactory())

// Use library normally - metrics automatically collected
@Dependency(\.pdf) var pdf
try await pdf.render(html: invoices, to: directory)
```

Available metrics:
- `htmltopdf_pdfs_generated_total` - Counter
- `htmltopdf_pdfs_failed_total` - Counter (with reason dimension)
- `htmltopdf_render_duration_seconds` - Timer (with mode dimension; p50/p95/p99)
- `htmltopdf_pool_replacements_total` - Counter
- `htmltopdf_pool_utilization` - Gauge
- `htmltopdf_throughput_pdfs_per_sec` - Gauge
